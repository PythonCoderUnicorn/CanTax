    business in 1 province has 3 options for selling in another province:
    a) have direct sales with sales agents who travel to province
    b) set up a new small scale branch for sales inside province
    c) set up a separate corporation inside province 

2. cash flow exists only on an after-tax basis

cash flow = revenue, expense, asset  aquisition, divesture , debt or equity restructuring
'after tax' decision making is business decision making
